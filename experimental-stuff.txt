1. The Data Backfill / Sync API (Recommended for you)


  This is the most practical and common approach.


   * Step 1: Create a Sync Endpoint: You would create a new, private API endpoint on the source service. For example, on your auth-service, you might create GET /api/v1/users/sync.
   * Step 2: Initial Startup Logic: When your new playlist-service starts up for the very first time, it does the following:
       * It calls the GET /api/v1/users/sync endpoint on the auth-service.
       * The auth-service responds with a list of all existing users.
       * The playlist-service takes this list and populates its own database with all the user data it needs.
   * Step 3: Switch to Live Events: Once this initial "backfill" is complete, the playlist-service then connects to RabbitMQ and starts listening for live events (user:created,
     user:updated, etc.) to keep its data up-to-date going forward.

  This method is robust, relatively simple to implement, and gives you a reliable way to bootstrap new services.
